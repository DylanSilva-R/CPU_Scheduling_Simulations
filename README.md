# CPU Scheduling Simulations.

## Description

This is the second project I had to create for OS. The project is seperated into two folders: Phase_One and Phase_Two. In Phase_One I created a program that compares first-come first-serve and shortest-job first CPU scheduling algorithms. The program runs each algorithm 100 times with random data and accumalates the average wait time, turnaround time, and idle time. Phase_Two was about investigating deadlock prevention and detection methods and applying it to a system.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* So far, there is no need to install any extra C libraries.
* All you need is a gcc compiler and make

### Installing

* Just clone the repository and you can access individual folders that contain their own programs.

### Executing program



```
cd src
make all
```
